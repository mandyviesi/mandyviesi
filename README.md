### Hey, I'm Amanda Vieira (she / her) 👩‍🔬

I'm a PhD student at Evolution and Diversity (Brazil) , but I'm doing a sandwich period at University of Michigan (USA)

I'm working on the costs of mutualistic interactions. Do you remember your teacher saying that mutualistic interactions, such as *pollination* 🐝🌸 has a positive outcome? So, yeah, that's not always so simple... And that's what I'm investigating right now.
For this, I use a lot of statistics for ecological modelling and trait evolution mostly in R.

Here, I'll share the code for the analysis I'm doing and some stuff I do for fun (such as Tidy Tuesday)

Reach me if you want to talk a little bit about ecology, evolution and R 😊

My personal website is still under construction, but you can see more details about my academic carreer [there](https://amandaviesi.weebly.com/)
